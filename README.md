# Real_Estate_Value_Prediction_Model
This project was focused towards creating a prediction model for real estate pricing using the Kings County Housing Data set. 
In the Data Cleaning notebook you will find all the steps I took during my EDA, and Modeling Process.
In the Holdout_Data notebook you will find the final model from the Data Cleaning notebook being run on a test data set.
